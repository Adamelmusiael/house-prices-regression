# Introduction
In this repository I will compare simple neural networks with ensemble methods in **House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques**. Since I have already some knowlage about tensorflow I would like to use it more in practice and see how much can I get from it.

# Overview
So the task is to predict house prices based on the 79 fatures that are describing the house. In competition submissions are evaluated on the RMSE (Root Mean Squeret Error).
